# X-Frame-Options middleware

The `X-Frame-Options` HTTP header restricts who can put your site in a frame which can help mitigate things like [clickjacking attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking). The header has two modes: `DENY` and `SAMEORIGIN`.

This header is superseded by [the `frame-ancestors` Content Security Policy directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors) but is still useful on old browsers.

If your app does not need to be framed (and most don't) you can use `DENY`. If your site can be in frames from the same origin, you can set it to `SAMEORIGIN`.

Usage:

```javascript
const frameguard = require("frameguard");

// Don't allow me to be in ANY frames:
app.use(frameguard({ action: "deny" }));

// Only let me be framed by people of the same origin:
app.use(frameguard({ action: "sameorigin" }));
app.use(frameguard()); // defaults to sameorigin
```
